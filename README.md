# RedTeam vs. BlueTeam Project
This was project was created to showcase the experience gained as a Penetration Tester and as a Security Analyst. This project shows knowledge in:
  ### Blue Team Defending
  1. Utilizing ELK stack to create effective alarms and watches
  2. Threat hunting and mitigating risks
  3. Analyze traffic on the wire and identify malicious traffic

  ### Red Team Attacking
  1. Using tools for effective passive and active reconnaisance
  2. Identify and exploit vulnerabilities
  3. Privilege escalation and Obfuscation

  ### Network Analysis
  1. Using Wireshark for network analysis
  2. Reviewing packets for malicious network traffic
  3. Filtering packet to pinpoint target data

In this repository you will find the steps taken in both of these phases. The [RED TEAM](OffensiveReport.md) document gives detailed steps on how vulnerabilities were found and exploited, as well as how privilege escalation was achieved. The [BLUE TEAM](DefensiveReport.md) document gives details on how alarms were put in place to detect malicious traffic and alert the security team. Also, the [NETWORK ANALYSIS](NetworkAnalysis.md) document shows how `Wireshark` was used to detect malicious network traffice and the verifying process of malware using `VirusTotal`.
